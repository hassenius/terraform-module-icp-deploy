# Terraform ICP Provision Module
This terraform module can be used to deploy IBM Cloud Private on any supported infrastructure vendor.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and RHEL 7 on SoftLayer, VMware, AWS and Azure.

### Pre-requisites

If the default SSH user is not the root user, the default user must have password-less sudo access.

## Outputs

- icp_public_key
    * The public key used for boot master to connect via ssh for cluster setup
- icp_private_key
    * The public key used for boot master to connect via ssh for cluster setup
- install_complete
    * Boolean value that is set to true when ICP installation process is completed
- icp_version
    * The ICP version that has been installed
- cluster_ips
    * List of IPs of the cluster

### ICP Version specifications
The `icp-version` field supports the format `org`/`repo`:`version`. `ibmcom` is the default organisation and `icp-inception` is the default repo, so if you're installing for example version `2.1.0.2` from Docker Hub it's sufficient to specify `2.1.0.2` as the version number.

It is also supported to install from private docker registries.
In this case the format is:
`username`:`password`@`private_registry_server`/`org`/`repo`:`version`.

So for exmaple

`myuser:SomeLongPassword@myprivateregistry.local/ibmcom/icp-inception:2.1.0.2`


### Remote Execution Hooks
It is possible to execute arbitrary commands between various phases of the cluster setup and installation process.
Currently, the following hooks are defined. Each hook must be a list of commands to run.

| Hook name          | Where executed | When executed                                              |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| cluster-preconfig  | all nodes      | Before any of the module scripts |
| cluster-postconfig | all nodes      | After prerequisites are installed |
| boot-preconfig     | boot master    | Before any module scripts on boot master |
| preinstall         | boot master    | After configuration image load and configuration generation|
| postinstall        | boot master    | After successful ICP installation                          |

### Local Execution Hooks
It is possible to execute arbitrary commands between various phases of the cluster setup and installation process.
Currently, the following hooks are defined. Each hook must be a single command to run.

| Hook name          | When executed                                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| local-preinstall   | After configuration and preinstall remote hook |
| local-postinstall  | After successful ICP installation |

These hooks support the execution of a single command or a local script. While this is a local-exec [command](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html#command), passing additional interpreter/environment parameters are not supported and therefore everything will be treated as a BASH script.


### Host groups
In ICP version 2.1.0.2 the concept of host groups were introduced. This allows users to define groups of hosts by an arbritrary name that will be labelled such that they can be dedicated to particular workloads. You can read more about host groups on the [KnowledgeCenter](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0.2/installing/hosts.html)

To support this an input map called `icp-host-groups` were introduced, and this can be used to generate the relevant hosts file for the ICP installer. When using this field it should be used **instead of** the `icp-master`, `icp-worker`, etc fields.

## Usage example

### Using hooks

```hcl
module "icpprovision" {
    source = "github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-module-icp-deploy?ref=2.3.1"

    icp-master  = ["${softlayer_virtual_guest.icpmaster.ipv4_address}"]
    icp-worker  = ["${softlayer_virtual_guest.icpworker.*.ipv4_address}"]
    icp-proxy   = ["${softlayer_virtual_guest.icpproxy.*.ipv4_address}"]

    icp-version = "2.1.0.1"

    cluster_size  = "${var.master["nodes"] + var.worker["nodes"] + var.proxy["nodes"]}"

    icp_configuration = {
      "network_cidr"              = "192.168.0.0/16"
      "service_cluster_ip_range"  = "172.16.0.1/24"
      "default_admin_password"    = "My0wnPassw0rd"
    }

    generate_key = true

    ssh_user     = "ubuntu"
    ssh_key_file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
    hooks = {
      "cluster-preconfig" = [
        "echo This will run on all nodes",
        "echo And I can run as many commands",
        "echo as I want",
        "echo ....they will run in order"
      ]
      "postinstall" = [
        "echo Performing some post install backup",
        "${ var.postinstallbackup != "true" ? "" : "sudo chmod a+x /tmp/icp_backup.sh ; sudo /tmp/icp_backup.sh" }"
      ]
    }
}
```


#### Using HostGroups

```hcl
module "icpprovision" {
    source = "github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-module-icp-deploy?ref=2.3.1"

    # We will define master, management, worker, proxy and va (Vulnerability Assistant) as well as a custom db2 group
    icp-host-groups = {
      master     = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpmaster.*.access_ip_v4}"
      management = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpmanagement.*.access_ip_v4}"
      worker     = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpworker.*.access_ip_v4}"
      proxy      = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpproxy.*.access_ip_v4}"
      va         = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpva.*.access_ip_v4}"

      hostgroup-db2        = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpdb2.*.access_ip_v4}"
    }

    # We always have to specify a node to bootstrap the cluster. It can be any of the cluster nodes, or a separate node that has network access to the cluster.
    # We will use the first master node as boot node to run the ansible installer from
    boot-node   = "${openstack_compute_instance_v2.icpmaster.0.access_ip_v4}"

    icp-version = "2.1.0.2"

    cluster_size  = "${var.master["nodes"] + var.worker["nodes"] + var.proxy["nodes"]}"

    icp_configuration = {
      "network_cidr"              = "192.168.0.0/16"
      "service_cluster_ip_range"  = "172.16.0.1/24"
      "default_admin_password"    = "My0wnPassw0rd"
    }
}
```

There are several examples for different providers available from [IBM Cloud Architecture Solutions Group github page](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture)
- [ICP on SoftLayer](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-icp-softlayer)
- [ICP on VMware](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-icp-vmware)


### ICP Configuration
Configuration file is generated from items in the following order

1. config.yaml shipped with ICP (if config_strategy = merge, else blank)
2. config.yaml specified in `icp_config_file`
3. key: value items specified in `icp_configuration`

Details on configuration items on ICP KnowledgeCenter
* [ICP 1.2.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_1.2.0/installing/config_yaml.html)
* [ICP 2.1.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0/installing/config_yaml.html)


### Scaling
The module supports automatic scaling of worker nodes.
To scale simply add more nodes in the root resource supplying the `icp-worker` variable.
You can see working examples for softlayer [in the icp-softlayer](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-icp-softlayer) repository

Please note, because of how terraform handles module dependencies and triggers, it is currently necessary to retrigger the scaling resource **after scaling down** nodes.
If you don't do this ICP will continue to report inactive nodes until the next scaling event.
To manually trigger the removal of deleted node, run these commands:

1. `terraform taint --module icpprovision null_resource.icp-worker-scaler`
2. `terraform apply`


## Module Versions

As new use cases and best practices emerge code will be added to and changed the in module. Any changes in the code leads to a new release version. The module versions follow a [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme.

To avoid breaking existing templates which depends on the module it is recommended to add a version tag to the module source when pulling directly from git.


### Versions and changes
